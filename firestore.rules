/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the NAFON AI Lab application,
 * focusing on a prototyping model that prioritizes strong authorization while
 * maintaining flexibility in data shapes for rapid development.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model enforces a clear separation between public and private data.
 * Public data, such as the project catalog, is readable by anyone, but write
 * operations are strictly locked down to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * User-specific data, like custom project orders, is protected using a strict
 * path-based ownership model, ensuring users can only access their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into two main collections:
 * 1. /projects/{projectId}: A top-level collection containing publicly readable
 *    project information.
 * 2. /users/{userId}/customOrders/{customOrderId}: A subcollection where each
 *    user's private custom order requests are stored, secured by their unique
 *    user ID in the path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Project Catalog: The `/projects` collection is world-readable to allow
 *   all visitors to browse project offerings. Write access is strictly limited
 *   to a designated super admin.
 * - Strict User Ownership: All data under `/users/{userId}` is strictly owned
 *   by the user corresponding to `{userId}`. This prevents any user from reading
 *   or writing another user's private data.
 * - No User Enumeration: Direct access to user documents (`/users/{userId}`) is
 *   denied to protect user privacy and prevent listing of all application users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset primarily relies on path-based authorization for user data, which
 * is highly performant and avoids costly `get()` calls. For example, access to a
 * custom order at `/users/USER_A/customOrders/ORDER_1` is granted simply by
 * checking if the authenticated user's ID is 'USER_A'.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The design correctly segregates public data (`/projects`) from private user data
 * (`/users/{userId}/customOrders`), ensuring that private information cannot be

 * accidentally exposed through list queries on public collections.
